Importance and Scope of Good Agricultural Practices for Flower Crops
Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) is a code of crop production practices that ensure
sustainable production of flower crops, that are environment friendly, economically viable,
socially acceptable and complies with the legal standards. The set of prescribed practices must
address efficient resource management besides ensuring higher yields and good quality on a
sustainable basis, must take care of the welfare and safety of persons working or living in the
farm. Use of quality planting material that follow the prescribed standards of uniformity,
tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress must be adhered to, so as to ensure input use efficiency
and sustainable production. The cultural practices must not have adverse effects on the
environment, like pollution of land, water and air.
The following aspects must be addressed for GAP in commercial flower crop production:
•

The farm should have a proper site history to understand the microclimate and other
associated factors which may affect the productivity, safety and quality of the produce to
avoid or minimize contamination.

•

The grower should have a clear identity in the form of registered grower as an individual,
group or society.

•

Record maintenance is must and cultivation sheets on crop production, cropping
sequences, crop rotations and systems.

•

Record of the variety used for production, names of root stock and scion in case of grafted
varieties have to be maintained. Record of periodical soil and water analysis has to be
maintained.

•

Documentation of manures and fertilizers applied and plant protection chemicals will
help in understanding its response in terms of yield and quality and further management
practices.

•

The produce must be traceable to the farm where it has been originally produced.

•

Safe production must adopt integrated pest, disease, weed and nematode management
approaches.

•

For safe handling of chemicals proper measuring devices and mixing equipment should be
used and appropriate method of disposal of containers and obsolete plant protection gear
should be adopted to avoid any kind of contamination and pollution.

•

Documentation of plant protection chemicals used and adopting safety measures like
using protective gear during application of these chemicals to avoid health hazards to the
workers is important. Additionally, ensure availability of first-aid kit at the farm.

•

Record maintenance by the farms must be up-to-date and the records must be maintained
and retained for at least 2 years unless otherwise stipulated by any specific legislation.
The records shall be accessible and audited.

Rose under open cultivation
Rose (Rosa hybrida L.) is the ‘Queen of Flowers’ which is cherished for its intrinsic beauty,
mesmerizing aroma and stupendous health benefits. Roses are grown under open cultivation
for loose flowers which are used for religious offerings, for preparation of garlands, extraction
of essential oils, rose water, rose syrup, gulkhand etc.

Importance and scope of Good Agricultural Practices:

•
•
•

Farmers use a lot of plant protection chemicals to get quality produce in commercial
cultivation of rose.
Since edible value added products are prepared from rose beside pigment and essential oil
extraction, GAP assumes a greater significance in commercial production of rose.
For economical and sustainable production and use of quality inputs at critical time, a set of
practices is enlisted below for GAP in rose.

Soil and climate

• Deep loamy soil rich in organic matter with pH of 5.5-6.5 is suited for rose cultivation
• Rose cultivation can be taken up ideally in cooler climate with bright sunlight
• Places with day temperature ranging between 25-30oC and night temperature of 15o-18oC
are suitable for rose production.
• At temperatures lower than the ideal, interval between flushes become longer. When the
temperature increases above 30oC, care has to be taken to provide high humidity and to
reduce the evaporation loss.

Planting material

• Improved varieties / hybrids released by research organizations or planting material
produced by registered nurseries should be used for commercial production
• The planting material should meet the minimum requirement of the standards with regard to
uniformity, size, vigour, it should be true to type and free from pest and diseases
• As far as possible varieties/hybrids which are resistant to major pests and diseases should
be selected for cultivation
• Special nutritional requirement for specific varieties/hybrids should be ascertained and the
nutrients management should be scheduled accordingly

Propagation

• Rose can be propagated by cutting / budding
• Take cutting / scions from a healthy, vigorous and disease-free mother plant
• Rose plants are propagated by budding or top-grafting on rootstocks like Rosa indica, R.
multiflora, and R. canina. ‘Nishkant’ variety of root stock are without any prickles and
easy to bud with high bud uptake.
• Budding in polybags is ideal for easy transportation of material
• Budded plants that are 3 months old are used for planting
• For bare rooted plants, budding has to be taken up in soil and can be shifted 6 months after
budding

Planting
•
•
•

Land should be prepared with thorough ploughing, harrowing and levelling
Nourish the soil with plenty of organic matter
Do not apply fresh manure for plant nutrition. Ensure that compost is well decomposed

•
•

before use
Get initial soil sample analysed by a nearby laboratory and plan any addition of plant
nutrients accordingly
Planting can be taken up in rows with spacing of 1 m × 1 m. Depending on the spacing,
pits or trenches of 1-2 feet depth is dug to fit roots in the proper position unbent.
Water the plants immediately after planting.
Care must be taken to ensure that the bud union must be 2-3 cm above soil

Aftercare
•
•
•
•

After planting, shade need to be provided to plants till the plants gets established
Building up of plant by proper training is important
Disbudding has to be done during the initial period of 4-6 months after planting
Removal of emerging rootstock buds in its initial growth is very essential as rootstocks are
vigorous and try to outgrow the budded cultivar
• Regular weeding has to be done

Manures and fertilizers
•
•
•
•
•

Regular analysis of soil, water and leaf will be good guide to supply optimum nutrients
Well decomposed organic manure @ 8 tonnes / acre is to be added and mixed well in the
soil before planting
Nutrient application of 240:80:280 kg NPK/acre/year is recommended
Fertilizers can be applied in equal split doses in monthly intervals
Soil application of micronutrient (FeSO4 and ZnSO4) @ 2 g/ plant or sq.m twice or thrice
in a year based on soil test report or foliar spraying of 0.1% (FeSO4 and ZnSO4) if visible
symptoms are seen

Irrigation

• Irrigate the plants according to the specific water requirements of the varieties
• Use water from a clean source. Do not use water that may be contaminated by chemicals or
waste materials
• The water requirement is 4-6 liter/m2/day through drip irrigation depending on the plant
growth and weather conditions

Harvesting

• Stage of harvest varies with the variety and distance to the market
• Harvesting is done during cool hours of the day, either in the early morning or in evening
hours
• Use clean and sharp harvesting tools
• Loose flowers are harvested at the initiation of flower opening
• Depending upon the market demand flowers can be harvested at different stages of petal
unfurling
• The average yield of flower is 15 t/acre/year
• Flowers has to be shifted to cool places immediately after harvesting
• Damaged/bruised flowers should be discarded and disposed hygienically
• For local market the loose flowers are transported in bamboo or in gunny bags

Rose under protected cultivation
Rose (Rosa hybrida L.) is a major commercial cut flower, widely cultivated in different parts
of the world. Among all other cut flowers, roses is most popular because of its beauty, variety,
fragrance and long lasting blooming season. For cut flower production it can be grown under
naturally ventilated, cost effective polyhouses or under fully climate-controlled polyhouses.

Importance and scope of Good Agricultural Practices:

•
•
•

Rose cultivation under protected conditions is done with usage of a number of plant
protection chemical sprays to get quality produce.
Under protected cultivation, the health of workers applying the hazardous chemicals also
has to be taken care of.
The first step towards producing safe crop begins at the farm level and is the responsibility
of the grower for which standard package of practices referred as Good Agriculture Practices
has to be followed.

Soil and climate

• Loamy soil rich in organic matter with pH of 5.5-6.5 is ideally suited
• The growing medium may consist of soil, sand and FYM in the ratio of 2:1:1. In place of
sand, sawdust can also be used.
• Rose cultivation can be taken up ideally in cooler climate with bright sunlight
• Places with day temperature ranging between 25-30oC and night temperature of 15-18oC are
suitable for rose production.
• At the temperature lower than the ideal, interval between flushes become longer. When the
temperature increases above 30oC, care has to be taken to provide high humidity and to
reduce the evaporation loss

Planting material

• Improved varieties / hybrids released by research organizations or planting material
produced by registered nurseries should be used for commercial production
• The planting material should meet the minimum requirement of the standards with regard to
uniformity, size, vigour, must be true to type and free of pest and diseases.
• As far as possible use varieties/hybrids which are resistant to major pests and diseases should
be selected for cultivation
• Special nutritional requirement for specific varieties/hybrids should be ascertained and the
nutrients management should be scheduled accordingly.

Propagation

• Cut roses can be propagated by budding or stenting
• Take cutting or scions from a healthy, vigorous and disease-free mother plant
• Rose plants are propagated by budding or top-grafting on rootstocks like Rosa indica, R.
multiflora, and R. canina. ‘Nishkant’ variety of root stock are without any prickles and
easy to bud with high bud uptake

For necessary cultural operations, 50 cm path can be accommodated between the beds

Aftercare

• Regular weeding has to be done

Special cultural practice for long stalk flower production
Bending of shoots
•

Four weeks after planting, shoots are bent to induce strong basal shoots. Development of
a good number of basal shoots is essential to build a strong framework in the plant.

Removal of buds from the rootstock
•

It has to be done to prevent the unwanted vegetative growth from the rootstock and to
encourage healthy buds from the scion

Disbudding

Tuberose
Tuberose (Polianthes tuberosa L.) belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is cultivated
commercially for its fragrant flowers which are used as loose flowers, cut flowers and in the
perfumery industry. The flowers of tuberose are highly fragrant and contain 0.08 to 0.14 % of
concrete and have high demand in international market. Flowers of the single type are
commonly used for extraction of essential oil, loose flowers, and for value addition, while that
of double varieties are used as cut flowers, for garden display and floral arrangements.

Importance of Good Agricultural Practices:
Tuberose is mainly used commercially as a loose flower, cut flower and for extraction of
concrete. Though the produce is not consumed directly, lot of inorganic fertilizers and plant
protection chemicals go into the crop production.
•
•

The first step towards producing safe crop begins at the farm level and it is the
responsibility of the grower, for which standard package of practices referred as good
agriculture practices has to be followed.
Economical and sustainable production by use of quality inputs in prescribed amounts at
critical time will help in achieving sustainable production, for which a set of practices in
tuberose, is enlisted below:

Suitable growing conditions
•
•

Tuberose thrives in moderate climate with temperature ranging from 20-30 o C. It performs
well in sunny situation.
Ideal soil is loamy to sandy loam, pH range of 6.5 to 7.5 with good aeration and drainag

Planting material
•
•
•
•
•

Improved varieties /hybrids released by research organizations or planting material
produced by registered nurseries should be used for commercial production.
The planting material should meet the minimum requirement of the standards with regard
to uniformity, size, vigour being true to type and being free of pest and diseases.
As far as possible use varieties/hybrids which are resistant to major pests and diseases.
Special nutritional requirement for specific varieties/hybrids should be ascertained and the
nutrient management should be scheduled accordingly.
Spindle shaped bulbs of 2.0-2.5 cm diameter are used as propagule to achieve uniform crop
stand.

Cultural practices
Land preparation
•
•
•
•

Selection of the site, should be followed by soil and water testing to ascertain the suitability
for cultivation.
Well drained loamy to sandy loam soil with adequate aeration and a pH of 6.5 to 7.5 is
recommended.
Land should be ploughed deeply 2 to 3 times and brought to a fine tilth.
Raised beds of 30 cm height, 0.9 m width and convenient length should be prepared
leaving 40 cm passage between two beds. Raised beds ensure better drainage of excess

Page | 11

water, ensure aeration for the roots and can be combined with drip irrigation and
fertigation system.

Manures and Manuring
•
•
•

•

For upkeep of soil health and to improve the organic matter content, 8 tonnes of well
decomposed farm yard manure should be applied in one acre at least 15 days prior to
planting.
The organic compost/ farm yard manure should be free from pathogens, nematodes, weed
seeds or any other harmful organisms.
Two tonnes/acre of well decomposed FYM/vermicompost/ deoiled neem cake has to be
enriched by mixing with 1 kg of each of Pseudomonas fluorescens + Trichoderma
harzianum + Paecilomyces lilacinus formulation under shade. It has to be covered with
mulch and optimum moisture of 25 - 30% has to be maintained for a period of 15 days.
This has to be incorporated into the beds before planting for control of nematodes.
Bio-fertilizers should be used to reduce the requirement of inorganic fertilizers. Farm yard
manure should be enriched with bio-fertilizers viz., Azospirillum/Azotobacter, Phosphate
solubilizing bacteria or Arka microbial consortium @ 1.0 kg each/ tonne of farm yard
manure and applied to the main field.

Fertilizer application to soil
•

•
•
•
•

The inorganic fertilizers should be applied based on the soil analysis and
recommendations only. This will help in providing optimum amount of nutrients to the
crop. Excess application of fertilizers should be avoided as it will lead to soil and water
pollution.
Application of 120:60:100 kg NPK/acre is recommended.
At the time of planting, 50 kg Urea, 30 kg Di ammonium phosphate and 40 kg Muriate of
potash /acre /year is applied as basal dose.
Three months after planting, 160 kg urea, 100 kg DAP and 130 kg MOP/acre/year can be
applied in three equal split doses at three monthly intervals.
Fertilizers should be placed in such a way that it should be easily accessible to the plant
roots.

Planting
•
•
•
•
•

Planting is done on raised beds in double row system with one drip line per bed.
Bulbs are planted at 2.5 cm depth at a spacing of 60cm x 45cm.
The recommended seed rate is 400 kg of bulbs/ acre
Ideal planting time is May to July.
Arka Microbial Consortium@12.5kg/ha /any certified consortium of bio-fertilizers can
be drenched 2 weeks after transplanting to enhance the growth.

Fertigation
•
•
•

Adopt fertigation for better fertilizer use efficiency and higher yield. For fertigation,
weekly application of the recommended dose of fertilizers can be followed.
As the fertilizer use efficiency is high under fertigation 75% of the recommended fertilizer
dose will be adequate to obtain the potential yield thereby resulting in saving of 25%
fertilizer input.
In a fertigation schedule, 25 per cent of the total quantity of nitrogen, phosphorous and
potassium can be applied to soil at the time of planting as straight fertilizers (Urea-66 kg,
Single Super Phosphate-94 kg, Muriate of Potash -42 kg /acre/year) to save the cost on

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

water soluble fertilizers. Remaining can be injected as through water soluble fertilizers.
Fertigation can be commenced from the third week after planting and continued at weekly
intervals.
The weekly fertigation schedule can be as follows:
0-20 days after planting: No fertigation
21-90 days after planting: 5.8 kg urea, 2.1 kg water soluble Mono Potassium Phosphate
(MKP) (0:54:32) and 2.4 kg/acre water soluble Sulphate of Potash (SOP) (0:0:50)
91-270 days after planting: 2.3 kg urea, 1.3 kg water soluble Mono Potassium Phosphate
(MKP) (0:54:32) and 1.5 kg/acre water soluble Sulphate of Potash (SOP) (0:0:50)
271-365 days after planting: 3 kg urea, 1.2 kg water soluble Mono Potassium Phosphate
(MKP) (0:54:32) and 1.4 kg/acre water soluble Sulphate of Potash (SOP) (0:0:50)
For the ratoon crop in the subsequent years the basal application of FYM and fertilizer has
to be repeated at the beginning of the rainy season.
If there is a specific recommendation based on the soil analysis for fertigation, the
schedule can be modified as per requirement.

Micronutrients
•

Need based foliar spray of ZnSO4 @ 0.5% + FeSO4 @ 0.2% + Boric acid @ 0.1% may also
be practiced for getting better growth and yield in tuberose

Irrigation
•
•
•

For successful cultivation, optimum moisture should be maintained throughout the
growing period. Tuberose requires 1000-1200 mm of water per year. Water can be saved
to the extent of 25-30 per cent in drip method of irrigation.
The frequency of irrigation depends on the climatic and soil conditions.
Daily irrigation through drip system has to be followed based on the stage of the crop
(crop factor) and daily evaporation.

Inter culture
•

Earthing up is an important operation to prevent exposure of bulbs

Weeding
•
•

The beds should be kept weed free throughout the crop period.
Regular need based manual weeding is required during the entire cropping period.

Harvesting and post-harvest handling
•
•
•

•
•
•
•

Tuberose starts flowering in about three months after planting.
For loose flower purpose, fully matured flower buds which are at the horizontal position
on flowers stalk have to be harvested during morning hours.
For use as cut flower, spikes have to be harvested when the first pair of flower buds opens
on the spike.
Harvesting has to be done during the cool hours of the day. All the containers into which
the flowers are placed should be cleaned before use.
Precooling of flowers to remove the field heat is an important operation to lower
respiration and prolong the shelf and vase life of flowers.
Damaged/bruised flowers should be discarded and disposed hygienically.
For local market the loose flowers are transported in bamboo containers lined with cloth
or with wet gunny bags or in gunny bags or polythene bags lined with newspaper. About

10-15 kg fresh flowers are packed in each basket
Cut flowers are bunched into bundles of 25, 50 or 100 spikes and transported in containers
holding water.
For long distance transport, corrugated card board boxes of dimension 95 x 40 x 20 cm
are used.

Harvesting, lifting and storage of bulbs
Harvesting stage of tuberose bulb is important for storage of bulbs and their growth. The
bulbs are harvested when the flowering is over and plant ceases to grow. At this stage, the
old leaves become dry and bulbs are almost dormant.
Irrigation should be withheld and soil is allowed to dry before digging out the bulbs.
After digging, the bulbs are lifted out; the bulblets of 2 to 2.5 cm diameter are separated
and used as seed stock for the next season.
The bulbs are graded based on their size and are placed to dry or cure.
The bulbs should be treated with fungicide and insecticide to prevent rotting and attack
of mealy bugs during storage. After treatment, they should be shade dried before storage
in a cool dry place.
The bulbs must be stored or have their position changed every few days to prevent fungal
attack and rotting.

Crop protection
Thrips, root mealy bugs and nematodes are the major pests of tuberose. Major diseases are
phoma blight, basal rot or stem rot and flower blight. Integrated approach to pest and disease
management ensures better control and in safe crop production.

Insect management
•
•

•
•
•

Grow resistant/tolerant varieties to avoid/ minimize pest incidence.
Thrips
can be controlled by spraying of oxydemeton methyl 25 EC @2 ml/litre or
dimethoate 30 EC @2 ml/litre or acephate 75 SP @1 g/litre along with 0.5% pongamia oil
at 15 days interval is recommended followed by drenching the soil with chlorpyriphos 20
EC @5 ml/litre.
Root mealy bugs can be managed by dipping the bulbs in chlorpyriphos 0.05% as a
prophylactic measure and drenching of chlorpyriphos 20 EC @5 ml/litre. Soil application
of neem cake at the time of planting can effectively control root mealybugs.
Soil drenching with chlorpyriphos 20EC @ 5 ml/litre or thiamethoxam 25WG @0.5g/litre
at monthly intervals is recommended for controlling the root mealybugs in the field.
Avoid spraying the same chemical repeatedly, as it may result in insecticide resistance by
the target pest.

Nematode management
•
•
•

Use of nematode free planting material and growing antagonistic crops like marigold,
mucuna (velvet bean) before planting tuberose
Treating tuberose bulbs with bio-pesticides like Pseudomonas fluorescens or Trichoderma
harzianum @ 10g/kg.
1 tonne of farm yard should be enriched with two kg each of the bio-pesticides, viz.,
Trichoderma harzianum, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Paecilomyces lilacinus and left
under shade for 2 to 3 weeks at 25 – 30% moisture. This has to be mixed thoroughly from
top to bottom once in three days and applied in field before planting.

Page | 14

•
•

For the standing crop, biopesticide enriched neem cake can also be mixed in water (1: 10
ratio), thoroughly filtered and applied through the drip or as soil drench.
Chemical nematicide, carbofuran 3 G @ 1 kg a.i. per ha can be applied at planting and
repeated after 45 days.

Disease management
•
•
•
•

Removal of affected leaves followed by application of carbendazim @2 g/l of water or
Propiconazole @ 1 ml/ litre of water will control Phoma blight.
Basal rot or stem rot can be managed by treating the collar portion and the soil with benlate,
carbendazim, iprodione or copper oxy chloride @ 2 g/litre of water.
Flower blight can be controlled by spraying carbendazim @ 2 g/litre of water.
Alternaria leaf spot can be managed by spraying with mancozeb @ 0.2%

Marigold
Marigold (Tagetes spp.) is one of the most popular flowering annuals grown for loose
flowers and also for landscape gardening and as pot plants. The flowers are suitable for
garlands and floral decorations. Carotenoids extracted from marigold flowers are the major
source of pigment for poultry feed. Marigold flowers are also in demand by
pharmaceutical industries for extraction of ‘Lutein’. It is popular as trap crop for
management of pests in most of the vegetable crops. It is also used in crop rotation for
management of nematode.

Importance and scope of Good Agricultural Practices
The first step towards producing safe crop begins at the farm level and is the responsibility of
the grower for which standard package of practices referred to as good agriculture practices has
to be followed.
• Since marigold is also used for extraction of dyes and pigments for use in poultry feed,
besides use as a traditional flower, safe production assumes importance in this crop.
• Economical and sustainable production and use of quality inputs at critical time is
important for which a set of practices is enlisted below for marigold:

Site selection

• Choose land that has access to a clean and reliable source of irrigation water
• Make sure there is sufficient space between marigold fields and other fields where pesticides
are used to prevent any sprays from contaminating your crops
• Even though marigold can be grown in various types of soils, loamy soil rich in organic
matter with pH of 6.0 to 7.0 is ideal for its cultivation.

Planting material

• Improved varieties / hybrids released by research organizations or planting material
produced by registered nurseries should be used for commercial production.
• The planting material should meet the minimum requirement of the standards with regard to
uniformity, size, vigour, true to type and free of pest and diseases.
• As far as possible use varieties/hybrids which are resistant to major pests and diseases.
• Special nutritional requirement for specific varieties/hybrids should be ascertained and the
nutrients management should be scheduled accordingly.

Seeds / planting material
Majority of the varieties and hybrids can be propagated by seeds. Seed rate for marigold
varies from 0.4 to 0.6 kg/acre and takes about 5-7 days for germination. Seeds can be sown in
nursery beds in lines in shallow furrows. Raised nursery beds of 15 cm height are prepared by
mixing 8-10 kg of well decomposed cow dung manure/m2. The width of the seedbed should
be around 1.2 m. Seedlings will be ready for planting 20-25 days after sowing.
Some hybrids are only vegetatively propagated by tip cuttings. Tip cuttings with 2-3
nodes of 6-8 cm should be prepared with clean and sharp secateurs. Basal node of the
cutting should be inserted into protray cells containing cocopeat for rooting. Cuttings placed
at a humidity of 80% roots better. Rooting can be obtained by 20-25 days.

• Use fresh seeds that were harvested during the previous season
• Use seeds that are in good condition and free of pests
• If you are collecting your own seeds label the seed packets with details of the species, the
origin and date of harvest or collection
• Do not use seeds or planting material that are in poor condition or if you do not know where
they came from and when they were harvested
• Procure seeds or planting material from reliable sources
• In case of rooted cuttings, take cuttings from a healthy, vigorous and disease-free mother
plant

Land Preparation
•
•
•
•
•

Land should be prepared with thorough ploughing, harrowing and levelling
Nourish the soil with plenty of organic matter
Do not apply fresh manure for plant nutrition. Ensure that compost is well decomposed
before use
Get initial soil sample analysed by a nearby laboratory and plan any addition of plant
nutrients accordingly
Farm yard manure @ 8 tonnes/acre should be applied during land preparation.

Planting

• Ensure correct spacing between plants and rows
• In main field, raised beds of 30 cm height and 0.9 m width are prepared
• Seedlings / rooted cuttings are planted in double row system on the beds

Irrigation and interculture

• Irrigate the plants according to the specific water requirements of the species / varieties – if
in doubt, seek guidance from an expert and plan the irrigation schedule accordingly. If
possible, test the irrigation water for any contaminants and adopt appropriate measures to
prevent contamination
• Do not irrigate the plants too little or too much
• Do not use water that may be contaminated by chemicals or waste materials
• In case of flood irrigation, irrigate the crop once in 4-6 days depending upon soil moisture and
weather conditions.
• If drip irrigation is adopted, schedule the irrigation daily and depending on the crop stage
and weather, the quantity of water should be regulated.
• Use mulch to maintain moisture in the soil and to inhibit growth of weeds
• Manage weeds before they start competing with the main crop for nutrients and light
• Do not allow weeds to produce seeds – this will increase weed growth the following year
• Do not allow the soil to dry up due to excessive weeding
• Weeding is done manually 3-4 times during the entire crop growth period.
• Pinch the buds and terminal portion of the plants till 4-6 weeks after transplanting to
encourage branching and increased number of flower bud formation.

Nutrient management
•
•

The recommended dose of FYM is 8 tonnes / acre with the fertilizer dose of 36:36:30 kg
NPK/ acre /year
Basal dose of urea – 19.8 kg/ac, Single super phosphate (SSP) -168.8 kg/ac, Muriate of
Potash (MOP) – 12.5 kg/ac can be applied on the beds. This is followed by fertigation as

41-70 days after planting: Urea - 3.5 kg; MAP (12:61:0) - 1.85 kg; SOP (0:0:50) - 5.6
kg/ac/week
Foliar spray of micro nutrients 1.25 g MgSO4 + 1 g ZnSO4 + 0.25 g Borax in 1 liter of
water twice during the crop season (1 and 2 months after transplanting) improves plant
growth and enhance flower quality

Harvesting and Yield
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Harvesting of flowers should be done during cool hours of the day, either in the morning
or evening.
All the tools used for harvesting and containers into which the flowers are placed should
be cleaned before use.
Flower yield depends upon season and cultural practices adopted.
Harvesting duration depends on variety; in general, 6-9 t/acre of flowers is expected.
Flowers has to be shifted to cool place immediately after harvesting
Damaged/bruised flowers should be discarded and disposed hygienically.
For local market the loose flowers are transported in bamboo or in gunny bags

Chrysanthemum under open cultivation
Chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum morifolium /Dendranthema grandiflora) belongs to the
family Asteraceae. It is a popular commercial flower crop grown in different parts of the world.
The word Chrysos means “golden” and anthos means “flower”. It is commonly known as
Queen of East/ Autumn Queen/ Guldaudi.

Importance and scope of Good Agricultural Practices:
Chrysanthemum is both a commercial crop and a popular exhibition flower. It is
suitable for making of garlands, veni, worship, planting in borders and pot culture (pot mums).
In the production process of chrysanthemums, lot of inorganic fertilizers and plant protection
chemicals are being utilized.
Standard package of practices referred as good agriculture practices must be followed
for chrysanthemum crop production as a first step towards producing safe crop. Along with
ensuring the production of safe crop, the welfare and safety of persons working in the
chrysanthemum farm should be taken into account by the producer or grower. A set of Good
Agricultural Practices that is needed to be followed for safe production of chrysanthemum
under open field is enlisted below.

Planting material
•
•
•
•
•
•

•

For commercial production of chrysanthemums under open field, use of improved varieties
/hybrids released by research organizations or planting material produced by registered
nurseries is recommended.
The chrysanthemum planting material should meet the minimum standards with regard to
uniformity, size, vigour being true to type and free from pests and diseases.
Chrysanthemum varieties/hybrids which are resistant to major pests and diseases should
be used for commercial production.
Ascertain the nutritional requirement for specific chrysanthemum varieties/hybrids and
schedule the nutrient management accordingly.
Vegetative propagation in chrysanthemum is mainly done using suckers or terminal
cuttings.
Suckers arise from the underground stem and these are separated and planted in prepared
nursery beds during January for stock plants. Regular pinching is performed in these plants
for vigorous and profuse branching. Some of these stock plants are used for preparation of
cuttings.
Vegetative propagation through cuttings is the most common and popular method.
Terminal Cuttings of 5-7 cm in length are taken form healthy stock plants in May-June.
The cuttings are prepared removing basal leaves and reducing the leaf area of remaining
leaves to half. The basal portions (less than half inch) of cuttings are dipped in rooting
hormone (1000 ppm solution of IBA for 30 sec) for better rooting. The lower portion
of cuttings is treated with copper fungicide to avoid fungal growth.

Cultural practices
Land preparation
•
•

Chrysanthemum with a shallow but fibrous root system is sensitive to water-logging and
prone to attack by diseases, such as root rot and wilt due to lack of aeration.
Well drained sandy loam soils with pH ranging between 6.5 and 7.0 are ideal for

Page | 20

chrysanthemum growing.
Chrysanthemum requires well prepared soil for proper growth and development.
The field should be ploughed 2 to 3 times before preparing the beds and levelled well.
Addition of organic matter improves the soil structure and helps in the proper development
of the plant.
Proper soil sterilization with a fungicide should be done before planting to
avoid soil borne diseases.

•
•
•
•

Manures and manuring
•
•

Chrysanthemum is a heavy feeder and hence they are to be adequately manured.
For the proper upkeep of soil health and to improve the organic matter, a basal dose of
well decomposed farm yard manure should be applied @ 8 tonnes per acre at least 15 days
prior to planting.
Ensure that the organic compost/ farm yard manure used are free from pathogens,
nematodes, weed seeds or any other harmful organisms.

•

Fertilizer application to soil
•
•

Inorganic fertilizers should be applied based on the soil analysis and recommendations
only, which will help in providing optimum amount of nutrients to the crop. Avoid the
excess application of inorganic fertilizers as it will lead to soil and water pollution.
Application of 40: 20: 40 kg NPK per acre is recommended.

Planting
•
•
•
•
•
•

Light and temperature are the two important environmental factors influencing
the growth and flowering in chrysanthemum.
As far as light is concerned, both photoperiod and the intensity have profound effects
on the growth and flowering of chrysanthemum. It is a short-day plant normally
initiates and flowers during September to December.
Planting should be done in such a way that flowering coincides with short day
conditions. Hence, planting during May-June is recommended.
The optimum plant population for growing chrysanthemum is 25,500 plants per acre.
The suckers or rooted cuttings are planted at a spacing of 30 cm x 30 cm on raised beds
Before planting, the roots of the suckers or slips are dipped in a systemic fungicide to
give protection against wilt.

Fertigation
•
•
•

•
•
•

Adopt fertigation for better fertilizer use efficiency and higher yield in chrysanthemum.
For fertigation, follow weekly application of the recommended dose of fertilizers.
The fertilizer use efficiency is reported to be high under fertigation. Hence 75% of the
recommended fertilizer dose will be adequate to obtain the potential yield thereby
resulting in considerable saving of 25% fertilizer input.
In a fertigation schedule, basal dose of 8 tonnes per acre FYM + Urea – 16.8 kg; SSP70 Kg and MOP – 12.8 Kg/acre should be applied to soil at the time of planting as
straight fertilizers. This will save the cost on water soluble fertilizers. This should be
followed by fertigation schedule which can be injected as water soluble fertilizers.
Fertigation in chrysanthemum can be commenced from the third week after planting and
continued at weekly intervals.
The weekly fertigation schedule can be as follows:
0-20 days after planting -No fertigation:

Page | 21

•
•
•
•
•

21-65 days after planting- Urea: 1.9 Kg, MAP (Mono Ammonium Phosphate): 3.1 Kg,
SOP (Sulphate of Potash): 2.5 kg/acre/week
66-100 days after planting-Urea: 2.3 Kg, MAP (Mono Ammonium Phosphate): 3.7 Kg,
SOP (Sulphate of Potash): 3.0 kg/acre/week
101-180 days after planting- Urea: 1.2 Kg, MAP (Mono Ammonium Phosphate): 1.8
Kg, SOP (Sulphate of Potash): 1.5 kg/acre/week
Application of Arka Microbial Consortium @ 12.5 kg/ha also increases flower yield in
chrysanthemum
Need based foliar spray of micronutrients ZnSO4 @ 0.25% + FeSO4 @ 0.2% + Boric
acid @ 0.1% at fortnightly intervals may also be practiced for getting better growth and
yield in chrysanthemum

Irrigation
•
•
•
•

For successful cultivation of chrysanthemum under open field, optimum moisture
should be maintained throughout the growing period. Water can be saved to the extent
of 25-30 per cent if drip method of irrigation is adopted.
The frequency of irrigation depends on the climatic and soil conditions.
Chrysanthemums are to be irrigated twice a week in the first two weeks and
subsequently at weekly intervals if flood irrigation is practiced.
Daily irrigation through drip system can be followed based on the stage of the crop and
daily evaporation.

Pinching
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

•
•

Pinching is the removal of terminal growing portion of stem to reduce plant height and
promote axillary branches
Only soft vegetative shoot tips 1.5 to 3 cm long are removed.
Pinching is most essential for small flowered chrysanthemum.
First pinching is done when the plants reach a height of 15-20 cm with 3-4 pairs of
leaves.
A second pinching may be necessary if the plants make straggly and lean growth.
Pinching increases the number of flowering stems in each plant; it can indirectly control
flowering date and bloom quality; the number of stems to a plant can easily be
controlled.
Two types of pinching are performed:
➢ Soft pinching: By this pinching the top soft tips of the shoot along with 2-3 open
leaves are removed.
➢ Hard pinching: It means removing a longer portion up to hard shoot.
In spray chrysanthemum numerous small to medium sized flowers are produced,
therefore, two pinchings are required to encourage lateral growth.
As a general rule rooted cuttings are pinched two weeks after planting or approximately
100 days before full bloom.

De-suckering
•
•
•
•

During the vegetative growth phase, chrysanthemum plants grow upwards and suckers
continue to develop from base of plants.
For proper and vigorous growth of plants, suckers are removed from time to time.
It is practiced to allow single stem to develop up to a certain height.
Without de-suckering the main plant will lose vigour and becomes weak.

Page | 22

Staking
•
•
•

Staking or support is necessary to prevent lodging and to keep the plants erect and to
maintain proper shape of plants and bloom.
Stakes are prepared mostly from bamboo sticks.
Staking of plants is required for vertical support of the plants.

Weeding
•

Weeding and hoeing are generally done manually as and when required, normally 8-10
times during the cropping period.

Use of Growth regulators
•
•

Crop growth regulation and flowering can be modified or controlled by the use of
growth regulators. Flower quality and yield can be improved by the use of regulators.
50 ppm GA3 can be sprayed at 30, 45 and 60 days after planting to increase the flower
yield.

Harvesting and Post-harvest handling
•
•

•
•
•
•
•
•

Chrysanthemum starts flowering in about three to four months after planting.
Harvesting has to be done during the cool hours of the day. All the containers into which
the flowers are placed should be cleaned before use.
Fully opened flowers are plucked with or without the peduncle.
Decorative types are harvested when the petals in the centre of the topmost flower is
almost fully developed.
Spray mums are generally harvested at the two thirds to three-fourths open stage;
Pot-mums are sent to the market with half to fully opened flowers.
Damaged/bruised chrysanthemum flowers should be discarded and disposed
hygienically.
For local market the loose flowers of chrysanthemum are packed in clean bamboo
baskets or in gunny bags.

Crop protection:
Aphids, bud borers, whitefly, leaf miner, thrips and mites are some of the major pests of
chrysanthemums. Major diseases are rust, white rust, root rot, bacterial blight, leaf spot and
flower blight and powdery mildew. Integrated approach should be ensured for pest and disease
management for safe crop production in chrysanthemum.

Insect management
•
•

•

•

Grow resistant/tolerant chrysanthemum varieties to avoid/ minimize pest incidence.
The activity of predatory coccinellid beetles and parasitoids can be encouraged in
chrysanthemum field to manage aphids. Aphids can be controlled by spraying of neem oil
@ 0.1 % at weekly interval when infestation starts on the plant. In case of severe infestation,
spray dimethoate 30 EC @2 ml/litre or acephate 75 SP @1 g/litre.
To control bud borer, install pheromone traps for monitoring the activity of adults.
Application of HaNPV @ 250 LE/ha followed by spraying of any neem formulations @ 2
ml/l is recommended. In case of severe incidence, spray indoxocarb 14.5 EC SC @ 1ml/l
or thiodicarb 75 WP @ 1g/l.
In case of leaf miner infestation, remove and destroy weeds which act as alternate hosts.
Cutting and discarding of heavily mined leaves reduce further damage. Spray of 5 % Neem
seed powder extract controls leaf miner. In case of severe infestation, spray abamectin 1.9

Page | 23

EC @ 0.5 ml/l or triazophos 40 EC @1.5 ml/litre.

Disease management
•
•
•

•
•

Spraying of affected plants with Wettable sulphur @ 3g/l or Propiconazole @ 1 ml/ litre
will control Rust.
White rust can be managed by spraying the chrysanthemum plants with Azoxystrobin @
1g/l or Chlorothalonil @ 2g/l
Root rot can be controlled by drenching with copper oxy chloride @ 2g/l or Bordeaux
mixture @ 1 %. It can also be managed by spraying and drenching with Ridomil MZ @
2g/l. Soil application or mixing of Trichoderma viridae and Pseudomonas flourescens with
FYM is also effective.
Leaf spot and flower blight can be managed by spraying with mancozeb @ 2 g/l at 10-15
days interval
Powdery mildew can be controlled by spraying with sulphur fungicides @ 2g/l or
Tridemorph @ 1g/l at 15-20 days interval. Carbendazim @ 2g/l or Azoxystrobin @ 1g/l
also controls the disease.

Chrysanthemum under protected cultivation
Chrysanthemum (Dendranthema grandiflora) belongs to the family Asteraceae and is
commonly known as Glory of East / Queen of East/ Autumn Queen/ Guldaudi. It is the
National Flower of Japan. It is a popular and leading commercial flower crop of many
countries. In Dutch cut flower auction, chrysanthemum ranks 2nd after rose. It is next only to
rose in value of international cut flower trade in the world market.

Importance and scope of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP)
In chrysanthemum, the erect and tall growing cultivars are suitable as cut flowers. The extralarge-bloomed cultivars are ideal for their exhibition value. In the production process of cut
flower chrysanthemums, lot of inorganic fertilizers and plant protection chemicals are being
utilized.
Standard package of practices primarily referred as good agriculture practices should be
adopted for production of chrysanthemum under protected cultivation as a first step towards
ensuring the production of safe crop. A list of Good Agricultural Practices that should be
followed for safe production of chrysanthemum under protected cultivation is enlisted below.

Planting material
•
•
•
•
•

For commercial production of chrysanthemums under protected cultivation, use of
improved varieties /hybrids released by research organizations or planting material
produced by registered nurseries is recommended.
The planting material should meet the minimum standards with regard to uniformity, size,
vigour being true to type and free from pests and diseases.
Chrysanthemum varieties/hybrids which are resistant to major pests and diseases should
be used for production.
Terminal cuttings and tissue culture plants are commonly used for cut flower production
under protected cultivation.
Terminal Cuttings of 5-7 cm in length are taken form healthy stock of mother plants. The
cuttings are prepared removing basal leaves and reducing the leaf area of remaining leaves
to half. The basal portions (less than half inch) of cuttings are dipped in rooting hormone
(1000 ppm solution of IBA for 30 sec) for better rooting. The lower portion of cuttings is
treated with copper fungicide to avoid fungal growth. These cuttings are put in seedling
protrays or in sand beds in shade conditions.

Cultural practices:
Growing conditions
Cut chrysanthemums are grown under protected structures like naturally ventilated
polyhouses with the following environmental conditions.
• For getting good flowering stems under protected cultivation, the optimum temperature
should be 16-18°C during the night and 24-28oC during the day.
• High relative humidity should be avoided inside the polyhouse. Humidity levels above
95% produce soft growth, which encourages fungal and bacterial diseases in
chrysanthemum.
• It is desirable to maintain a relative humidity of 60-70% during crop growth and flower
Page | 25

bud development.
•

CO2 levels of 600 - 900 ppm is recommended in closed environment

Photoperiod
•
•
•

In protected cultivation, the chrysanthemum crop is accurately programmed by
application of artificial lighting and blacking out treatments
Long day conditions with 13 hours light and 11 hours darkness should be provided during
the vegetative stage (up to 4-5 weeks from planting) and short-day conditions should be
imposed with 10 hours light and 14 hours darkness during the flower bud initiation stage
For commercial flower production under polyhouses, programmed blooming is necessary
to ensure year-round availability of flowers.

Land and Bed preparation:
•
•
•
•

Well drained sandy loam soil rich in organic matter with good texture and aeration or
growing medium which is composed of soil, compost and cocopeat (1: 1: 2) with pH
ranging from 5.5 to 6.5 is ideal.
The beds for growing chrysanthemums are formed with 1 m width, 30 cm height and at
convenient length.
The soil pH must be 5.5 to 6.5 with 1 to 1.5 EC (Electrical Conductivity).
Soil sterilization should be done by drenching the soil beds with 5% solution of
formaldehyde @ 4 liters/sq.m and covering them with polyethylene sheets for 2-3 weeks.

Planting
•
•
•
•
•
•

The optimum planting density and spacing is mentioned below
15x 15 cm (45 plants/m2) for spray chrysanthemums
12.5 x 12.5 cm (64 plants/m2) for standard chrysanthemums
Planting of rooted cuttings are done preferably during evening hours.
After planting the rooted cuttings, a mist of 4-5 m3 water/ 1,000 m2 area is given to wet
the root and create 85% relative humidity.
Misting is done regularly in morning and evening for 4-5 days to maintain sufficient
moisture.

Fertigation
•
•

NPK @ 20:20:10 g/m2 is applied through fertigation at weekly intervals
A foliar spray of 0.2 per cent EDTA micronutrient mixture or ZnSO4 @ 0.25% + FeSO4
@ 0.2% + Boric acid @ 0.1% at 15 days intervals will improve the growth, physiology,
yield and quality of cut chrysanthemums.

For successful cultivation of chrysanthemum under protected cultivation, optimum
moisture should be maintained throughout the growing period. Water can be saved to
the extent of 25-30 per cent in drip method of irrigation.
Drip irrigation with 8-9 litres of water/sq.m/day is considered ideal for protected
cultivation
Frequency of irrigation depends on stage of growth, soil and weather conditions

•

Proper drainage system should be maintained for chrysanthemum grown in beds under
protected structures

Support structure / Crop support netting
•
•
•
•
•

Bamboos 4 ft in height or iron guards are fitted every 3 ft along the length of the bed.
A nylon crop supporting net of 12.5 cm x12.5 cm mesh are spread on this support structure
before the plant is tall enough to get entangled.
Use of nylon net ladders provides support against lodging to get straight cut stems under
protected cultivation.
When laid horizontally, the support plastic netting in layers becomes a fairly effective
guide to space-keeping in planting.
Successive layers of support nets can be fixed at the brackets with continuing growth of
plants.

Pinching
•
•
•

In spray chrysanthemum, pinching the soft growth at 3-5 leaf stage is done to produce
many lateral stems and only 2-3 healthy stems are retained per plant after thinning out the
weaker ones.
In standard chrysanthemum, only a single stem is retained by disbudding the lateral
branches and buds as against the removal of the terminal bud in spray types
For taking one bloom per plant no pinching is done. Only the main stem is allowed to
grow.

Disbudding
•
•
•
•
•
•

These operations are mostly performed for large flowered and decorative
chrysanthemums.
In standard varieties, all the lateral/ axillary buds are removed and only the largest
terminal or apical buds are allowed to retain and develop.
In spray varieties, only the large apical bud is removed and the lateral /axillary buds are
retained and are allowed to develop
For taking three blooms per plant, three lateral strong shoots are allowed to grow and
others are removed.
Lateral buds and side shoots are removed at their early stage of growth from time to time.
Removal of undesirable lateral buds and shoots are done.

De-shooting
•
•

De-shooting is practiced to reduce the number of branches for improving the size and
form of the flower.
Retain 4-5 shoots in standard chrysanthemums and 8-12 shoots in spray chrysanthemums

Desuckering
•
•

For proper and vigorous growth of the plant; suckers are removed from time to time.
Without de-suckering, the main plant will lose vigour and become weak.

Use of growth regulators
•

Spray of GA3 @ 50 ppm at 30, 45 and 60 days after planting can be done to increase the
flower stem length.

Weeding
Weeds should be avoided in the greenhouse since they deplete moisture and nourishment
from plants.
2-3 hand weedings are required. First weeding should be done one month after planting.
Weeding and hoeing are done manually as and when required.

Harvesting and Post-harvest handling
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Depending upon varieties plant start yielding flower after 3-4 months of transplanting.
Correct stages of harvest depend up on the cultivar, marketing and purpose
Standard chrysanthemums are generally harvested, when outer row of ray florets starts
unfurling and cease to elongate for distant market and half opened flowers for local
market
Spray chrysanthemums are harvested, when 50% flowers have shown colour for distant
market and when two flowers have opened and others have shown colour for local market
Cutting of the flower stems should be done at about 10 cm above the soil to avoid cutting
wooden tissue and leaves from lower one-third of stems are stripped off
Harvested flowers are to be kept immediately in a clean bucket containing water and floral
preservatives to avoid desiccation.
The lower one third of stem are placed immediately in water containing a biocide to
prevent the growth of microorganisms and to extend the vase life of cut flowers.
In the packing house, flowers are sorted into different grades as heavy stems 70-80 cm
and lighter stems of 60 cm and kept in clean buckets at 2°C in cold storage.

Cold storage
•
•

The stems after grading are given a cut using sharp blade and precooled at 10 o C minimum
of 2 hours before packing
Mature chrysanthemum can be stored dry for 3-8 weeks period at a temperature of 0-3 o
C.

Packaging of Cut flowers
•
•
•

After harvest, the stems have to be cut at equal length (90 cm is the standard)
Early morning on day of shipment /night before, bunches can be packed in boxes.
Wrap flower bunches in cellophane sleeves.

Packaging of Standard chrysanthemums
•
•
•
•

Bunched in 5, 10, 20 or 25 putting a rubber band at base and slide them into a transparent
plastic sleeve
They are placed in sleeves and packed in display boxes / corrugated cardboard boxes
measuring 91 x 43 x 15 cm (L x W x H)
It accommodates about 80-100 cut flowers of chrysanthemum.
They are placed in boxes according to the grades

Packaging of Spray chrysanthemums
•
•

10, 15 or 20 stems are placed in sleeves according to the grades
Six sleeves, three at each end are generally packed in each corrugated cardboard box,
measuring 80 x 50 x 23 cm (L x W x H)

Crop protection
Aphids, whitefly, leaf miner, thrips, leaf folder, hairy caterpillars, grubs, red spider mites and
nematodes are some of the major pests of chrysanthemums under protected cultivation. Major
diseases are wilt, stem and foot rot, rust, white rust, root rot, bacterial blight, grey mold, leaf
spot and flower blight and powdery mildew. Viral diseases like chrysanthemum stunt, tomato
spotted wilt, tomato aspermy, flower distortion, chrysanthemum mosaic and chrysanthemum
rosette also affect chrysanthemum. Integrated approach should be ensured for pest and
disease management for safe crop production in chrysanthemum grown under protected
cultivation.

Insect management

•
•

•
•

Growing of resistant/tolerant chrysanthemum varieties to minimize the pest incidence.
Aqueous spray application of entomogenous fungus Verticillium lecanii (Vertilec) @ 15
g/lit (108 CFU/g) controls Aphids. Aphids can be controlled by spraying of neem oil @
0.1 % at weekly interval when infestation starts on the plant. In case of severe infestation,
spray dimethoate 30 EC @2 ml/litre or acephate 75 SP @1 g/litre. Neem formulations
can be used in rotation with regular insecticides
In case of leaf miner infestation, remove and destroy weeds which act as alternate hosts.
Cutting and discarding of heavily mined leaves reduce further damage and help in
containing the spread. Spray 0.05% Monocrotophos or 0.05% Triazophos.
Blue sticky traps can be used for mass trapping of thrips. Release of nymphs and adults
of predatory minute pirate bug, Orius insidiosus is effective in control of thrips. Spray
dimethoate 30 EC @ 1 ml/litre or fenitrothion 50 EC @ 1.0 ml/litre 2 or 3 times at 15
days interval. Application of spinosad is very effective against thrips.
Spray of 0.05% Dicofol or 0.05% Vertimac or Pentac at fortnightly interval to control
mites
Spraying of 0.02% Cypermethrin or 0.02% Decamethrin or 0.05% Quinalphos at
fortnightly interval is effective to control leaf folder

Disease management
•

•
•
•

•

Use resistant varieties to manage wilt. Before planting, dip the rooted cuttings in a
solution of Pseudomonas fluorescens @2g/litre of water. Dipping of rooted cuttings in
Benomyl suspension before planting is also effective. Since wilt disease spreads mostly
through cuttings, it is important to use disease free planting material. Disease can further
be minimized by following strict sanitation; periodical monitoring; crop rotation and
roguing of infected plants. Solarization of soil should be done by using black polythene
mulch during summer months.
Sanitation and clean cultivation prevent rust. Early removal of infected leaves/plants
helps to prevent the further spread of the disease. Spraying of affected plants with
Wettable sulphur @ 3g/l or Propiconazole @ 1 ml/ litre will control Rust.
White rust can be managed by spraying the chrysanthemum plants with Azoxystrobin @
1g/l or Chlorothalonil @ 2g/l
Root rot can be controlled by soil drenching with copper oxy chloride @ 2g/l or Bordeaux
mixture @ 1 %. It can also be managed by spraying and drenching with Ridomil MZ @
2g/l. Soil application or mixing of Trichoderma viridae and Pseudomonas fluoresce with
FYM is also effective. Provide good drainage conditions to prevent water logging.
Destruction of disease debris and avoiding excessive irrigation is recommended to
manage leaf spot and flower blight. Spraying with Mancozeb @ 2 g/l or Copper

Page | 29

•

Oxychloride (0.2%) at 10-15 days interval helps in controlling the disease.
Powdery mildew can be controlled by spraying with sulphur fungicides @ 2g/l or
Tridemorph @ 1g/l at 15-20 days interval. Carbendazim @ 2g/l or Azoxystrobin @ 1g/l
also controls the disease. Good ventilation and proper spacing for free circulation of air
is recommended.

Aster
Aster (Callistephus chinensis (L.) Nees.) belongs to the family Asteraceae and is a flowering
annual cultivated commercially for its colourful and showy plants which are used as loose
flowers, cut flowers, potted plants and as bedding or border plants for landscaping. Wide range
of colours, flower forms and plant growth renders aster a versatile crop for varied uses.

Importance and scope of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP):
Aster is cultivated commercially as a loose flower, cut flower, potted plants and in landscapes.
Though the produce is not consumed directly, lot of inorganic fertilizers and plant protection
chemicals go into the crop production.
• The first step towards producing safe crop begins at the farm level and is the responsibility
of the grower for which standard package of practices referred as good agriculture practices
has to be followed.
• Economical and sustainable production by use of quality inputs in prescribed amounts at
critical time will help in achieving sustainable production, for which a set of practices is
enlisted below as for GAP in aster.

Suitable growing conditions
•

Aster performs well in an open sunny location. Temperature range of 20-30oC during day
and 15-17oC during night with relative humidity of 50-60% is the most suitable.
Well drained red loamy soil with pH around 6.0 is the best.
In places with moderate climatic conditions, it can be grown round the year, however, JulySeptember planting is the most ideal.

•
•

Planting material
•

Improved varieties /hybrids released by research organizations or planting material
produced by registered nurseries should be used for commercial production.
The seeds should meet the minimum requirement of the standards with regard to
uniformity, vigour being true to type and being free of pest and diseases.
As far as possible use varieties/hybrids which are resistant to major pests and diseases.
Special nutritional requirement for specific varieties/hybrids should be ascertained and the
nutrient management should be scheduled accordingly.
Aster is propagated through seeds. The seed rate requirement is 300 g/acre.

•
•
•
•

Cultural practices
Land preparation
•

Selection of the site, should be followed by soil and water testing to ascertain the suitability
for cultivation.
Well drained loamy to sandy loam soil with adequate aeration and a pH of 6.0. is ideal.
Land should be ploughed deeply two to three times and brought to a fine tilth.
Raised beds of 30 cm height, 1.2 m width and convenient length should be prepared
leaving 40 cm passage between two beds. Raised beds ensure better drainage of excess
water, ensure aeration for the roots and can be combined with drip irrigation and
fertigation system.

•
•
•

Nursery raising
•

Seeds are sown in raised beds prepared with fine mixture of red soil, sand and farm yard

Page | 31

•
•

manure (1:1:1 v/v).
Seedlings can also be raised in pro-trays with cocopeat as a substrate.
The seeds must be sown thinly about 0.5 cm deep in rows across the length at 10-12 cm
apart and covered with a mixture of soil and farm yard manure.

Manures and Manuring
•
•
•

For upkeep of soil health and to improve the organic matter, 8 tonnes of well decomposed
farm yard manure should be applied in one acre at least 15 days before taking up planting.
The organic compost/ farm yard manure should be free from pathogens, nematodes, weed
seeds or any other harmful organisms.
Bio-fertilizers should be used to reduce the requirement of inorganic fertilizers. Farm
yard manure should be enriched with bio-fertilizers viz., Azospirillum/Azotobacter,
Phosphate solubilizing bacteria or Arka microbial consortium @ 1.0 kg each/ tonne of
farm yard manure and apply to the main field.

Fertilizer application to soil
•

•
•
•

The inorganic fertilizers should be applied based on the soil analysis and
recommendations only. This will help in providing optimum amount of nutrients to the
crop. Excess application of fertilizers should be avoided as it will lead to soil and water
pollution.
Application of 72:48:24 kg NPK/acre is recommended.
At the time of planting, full dose of P and K and half dose of N is recommended as
basal dose whereas the remaining N is applied as top dressing 40 days after
transplanting.
Fertilizers should be placed in such a way that it should be easily accessible to the plant
roots.

Transplanting
•
•
•
•
•

Planting is done on raised beds in four row system with two drip lines per bed.
Planting is done at a spacing of 30cm x 30cm.
About one month old seedlings are usually transplanted when they have developed
about three to four leaves.
The transplanting should be done preferably during early morning or evening to avoid
bright sunshine.
Arka Microbial Consortium@12.5kg/ha or any certified consortium of bio-fertilizers
can be drenched 2 weeks after transplanting to enhance the growth.

Fertigation
•
•
•

•

Adopt fertigation for better fertilizer use efficiency and higher yield. For fertigation,
weekly application of the recommended dose of fertilizers can be followed.
As the fertilizer use efficiency is high under fertigation 75% of the recommended
fertilizer dose will be adequate to obtain the potential yield thereby resulting in saving
of 25% fertilizer input.
In a fertigation schedule, 25 per cent of the total quantity of nitrogen, phosphorus and
potassium can be applied to soil at the time of planting as straight fertilizers (Urea-40kg,
Single Super Phosphate-75kg, Muriate of Potash -10 kg /acre/year) to save the cost on
water soluble fertilizers. Remaining can be injected as through water soluble fertilizers.
Fertigation can be commenced from the third week after planting and continued at
weekly intervals.

Page | 32

The weekly fertigation schedule can be as follows:
0-20 days after planting: No fertigation
20-40 days after planting: Urea- 14.8 kg; MAP (12:61:0)- 3.9 kg; SOP (0:0:50)-2.4
kg/ac/ week
• 40-55 days after planting- Urea- 14.7 kg; MAP (12:61:0)- 11.8 kg; SOP (0:0:50)-7.2
kg/ac/ week
• 55-90 days after planting- Urea- 5.9 kg; MAP (12:61:0)- 4.7 kg; SOP (0:0:50)-2.9 kg/ac/
week
• If there is a specific recommendation based on the soil analysis for fertigation, the
schedule can be modified as per requirement.
•
•

Irrigation
•
•
•

For successful cultivation, optimum moisture should be maintained throughout the
growing period. Aster requires 400-450 mm of water per cropping season. Water can
be saved to the extent of 25-30 per cent in drip method of irrigation.
The frequency of irrigation depends on the climatic and soil conditions.
Daily irrigation through drip system has to be followed based on the stage of the crop
(crop factor) and daily evaporation.

Pinching
•

Pinching of main shoot at one month after transplanting increases number of nodes,
branches, flowers per plant and flower yield per unit area.

Inter culture
•

Earthing up is an important operation to prevent lodging of erect varieties.

Weeding

•
•

The beds should be kept weed free throughout the crop period.
Regular hand weeding may be done in early stages of crop growth.

Harvesting and post-harvest handling
•
•
•
•
•
•

Fully opened individual flowers or flowers along with stalk are harvested for garland
making, whereas for cut flower, the whole plant is harvested when 60 per cent flowers are
fully opened
Harvesting has to be done during the cool hours of the day. All the containers into which
the flowers are placed should be cleaned before use.
Precooling of flowers to remove the field heat is an important operation to lower
respiration and prolong the shelf and vase life of flowers.
Damaged/bruised flowers should be discarded and disposed hygienically.
For local market the loose flowers are transported in bamboo containers lined with cloth
or with wet gunny bags or in gunny bags or polythene bags lined with newspaper.
Cut flowers are bunched and transported in containers holding water.

Crop protection
Aphids, leaf hoppers, leaf miner, thrips and mites are some of the major pests of aster. Major
diseases are collar rot, and wilt. Integrated approach to pest and disease management ensures
better control and in safe crop production.
Page | 33

Insect management
•
•
•
•
•
•

Grow resistant/tolerant varieties to avoid/ minimize pest incidence.
Flower caterpillars can be controlled by spraying fenvalerate 20 EC @ 0.5 ml/l or neem
seed kernel extract 5%. If the incidence is severe, spray indoxacarb 14.5SC @ 1 ml/l.
Stem borer can be managed by collecting and destroying infested shoots. Spray
profenophos 50 EC @ 1 ml/l or ethofenprox 10 EC @ 1ml/l. If the incidence is severe,
apply carbofuran 3G granules @ 1 kg.a.i./ha (33 kg/ha).
Spraying acephate 75 SP @ 1.5 g/l or dimethoate 30 EC @ 2 ml/l or spraying Neem or
Pongamia oil 1% at early incidence is recommended for controlling the aphids.
To control Leaf miner, spray triazophos 40 EC @ 1.5 ml/L for management. Repeated
sprays are to be avoided.
Mites can be managed by spraying dicofol 18.5 EC @ 2.5 ml/l or fenazaquin 10 EC @ 1
ml/l or profenofos 50 EC @ 1 ml/l.

Aster yellow management
•
•
•

Since disease is transmitted by leaf hoppers, prophylactic spray with systemic insecticides
in rotation has to be taken up.
Destruction of diseased plant immediately after the appearance of the symptoms helps in
minimizing the spread of the disease.
Keep the field weed free and maintain proper distance from other crops that can act as host
is important for management of this problem.

Disease management
•
•

Collar and root rot can be controlled by drenching the soil with captan (2 g/l), mancozeb (2
g/l) and metalaxyl (1 g/l).
For management of wilt, Benlate (0.1%) or carbendazim (0.1%) can be used.

Gerbera under protected cultivation
Gerbera (Gerbera jamesonii Bolus ex. Hook F) belongs to the family Asteraceae and is
commonly known as Transvaal daisy, Barberton daisy or African daisy. It is an important cut
flower, potted plant and is also ideal for beds and borders in gardens. The flowers are
available in wide range of colours including yellow, orange, cream white, pink, red and
various other intermediate shades. Based on the flower heads, they are grouped into single,
double and semi-double. Major gerbera producing states in India are Karnataka, Maharashtra,
Uttarakhand, Assam, Meghalaya, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur,
Mizoram, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh.

Importance and scope of Good Agricultural Practices:
Safe production of crops is being emphasized worldwide. Many of the flower crops are used
for aesthetic purpose and only a few are directly consumed or used as food additives.
• Gerbera is mainly used commercially as a cut flower and as potted plants. Though the
produce is not consumed directly, lot of inorganic fertilizers and plant protection
chemicals go into the production of this crop, to achieve the prescribed quality standards.
• The first step towards producing safe crop begins at the farm level and is the responsibility
of the grower for which standard package of practices referred as good agriculture
practices has to be followed.
• Cultivation of gerbera in polyhouse in closed environments increases the risk of workers
being exposed to harmful chemicals. Meeting concerns on the welfare and safety of
persons working or living in the farm is the sole responsibility of the producer/ grower.
• Economical and sustainable production and use of quality inputs at critical crop phases to
make production sustainable also is a major aspect of GAP. A set of practices is enlisted
below for GAP in Gerbera.

Suitable growing conditions:
•
•

Gerbera requires sufficient sunlight for growth and flower production. However, too much
of sunlight can reduce the flower quality and hence partial shade has to be provided using
shade nets.
The optimum day and night temperature is 27oC and 14oC respectively. For flower
initiation, the optimum temperature is 23- 25oC.

Planting material
•
•
•
•
•

Improved varieties /hybrids released by research organizations or planting material
produced by registered companies of India should be used for commercial production.
The planting material should meet the minimum requirement of the standards with regard
to uniformity, size, vigour being true to type and being free of pest and diseases.
As far as possible use varieties/hybrids which are resistant to major pests and diseases.
Special nutritional requirement for specific varieties/hybrids should be ascertained and the
nutrients management should be scheduled accordingly.
Propagation through tissue culture is the most common method and is a large scale and
commercial method of multiplication of gerbera. Suckers can also be used by division of
clumps though it is not a common practice in many of the commercial units for cut flower
production.

Page | 35

Cultural practices
Land preparation
•

Selection of the site, should be followed by soil and water testing and if needed further
reclamation has to be done.
Well drained deep loamy soil with adequate aeration and a pH of 5.5 to 6.5 will ensure
effective nutrient uptake by the plants.
The EC of soil should be 0.5-2.0 dS/cm2.
Land should be ploughed deep 2 to 3 times and brought to a fine tilth.
The growing media comprising of a mixture of soil, sand, cocopeat and well decomposed
farm yard manure (15 t/ha) has to be fumigated with 2% formaldehyde (100 ml formalin
in 5 liters of water per sq.m. area).
Thoroughly drain the fumigants from the media before planting.
Raised beds of 30-45 cm height, 0.6 m width and convenient length should be prepared
leaving 40 cm passage between two beds. Raised beds ensure better drainage of excess
water, ensure aeration for the roots and can be combined with drip irrigation and
fertigation system.

•
•
•
•
•
•

Manures and Manuring
•

For upkeep of soil health and to improve the organic matter, 20 tonnes of well
decomposed farm yard manure should be applied in one hectare at least 15 days prior to
planting.
The organic compost/ farm yard manure should be free from pathogens, nematodes, weed
seeds or any other harmful organisms.
Five tonnes/ ha of well decomposed FYM/vermicompost/ deoiled neem cake has to be
enriched by mixing with 2 kg of each of Pseudomonas fluorescens + Trichoderma
harzianum + Paecilomyces lilacinus formulation under shade. It has to be covered with
mulch and optimum moisture of 25 - 30% has to be maintained for a period of 15 days.
This has to be incorporated into the beds before planting for control of nematodes.
Bio-fertilizers should be used to reduce the requirement of inorganic fertilizers. Farm yard
manure should be enriched with bio-fertilizers viz., Azospirillum/Azotobacter, Phosphate
solubilizing bacteria or Arka microbial consortium @ 1.0 kg each/ ton of farm yard manure
and apply to the main field.

•
•

•

Fertilizer application to soil
•

•
•
•

The inorganic fertilizers should be applied based on the soil analysis and
recommendations only. This will help in providing optimum amount of nutrients to the
crop. Excess application of fertilizers should be avoided as it will lead to soil and water
pollution.
Application of 10:15:20 g NPK/m2/month during first three months of planting and
15:10:30 g NPK/m2/month from fourth month when flowering starts.
Fertilizer application in two splits at 15 days interval is desirable for good growth and
increased flower production.
Fertilizers should be placed in such a way that it should be easily accessible to the plant
roots.

Planting
•
•

Gerbera planting is normally done in two seasons viz., January to March and June to
August.
Tissue cultured plug plants (4-5 leaves) should be planted in such a way that their crown

Page | 36

•
•
•

is slightly above the soil. Care has to be taken to avoid covering of the crown by the
growing media.
Planting is done at a spacing of 30cm x 30cm. After planting, relative humidity inside
the greenhouse should be kept 70-80% or shade net should be remaining closed for 46 weeks to avoid desiccation of plants.
As a precautionary measure drench Copper oxy chloride (COC) @ 2.0g/l immediately
after planting.
Arka Microbial Consortium@12.5kg/ha /any certified consortium of bio-fertilizers can
be drenched 2 weeks after transplanting to enhance the growth.

Fertigation
•
•
•

•

Adopt fertigation for better fertilizer use efficiency and higher yield. For fertigation,
weekly application of the recommended dose of fertilizers can be followed.
As the fertilizer use efficiency is high under fertigation 75% of the recommended
fertilizer dose will be adequate to obtain the potential yield thereby resulting in saving
of 25% fertilizer input.
In a fertigation schedule, 25 per cent of the total quantity of nitrogen, phosphorous and
potassium can be applied to soil at the time of planting as straight fertilizers (Urea-30g,
Single Super Phosphate-40 g, Muriate of Potash -35 g/m2) to save the cost on water
soluble fertilizers. Calcium nitrate@ 15g/m2 is also applied as basal dose. Remaining
can be injected as through water soluble fertilizers.
Fertigation can be commenced from the third week after planting and continued at
weekly intervals.
The fertigation schedule can be as follows:
• Vegetative phase (up to 3MAP)- 0-20 days- no fertigation; 21-90 days- Urea-5g, Mono
ammonium phosphate-1.0g, Sulphate of potash-4.0 g/m2per fertigation/ week
• Flowering phase (4MAP onwards)- Urea-2.5g, Mono ammonium phosphate-1.5g,
Sulphate of potash-7.0 g/m2 per fertigation/week
• If there is a specific recommendation based on the soil analysis for fertigation, the
schedule can be modified as per requirement.

Micronutrients
•

Foliar spray of micronutrients such as boron, calcium, magnesium and copper @ 0.15%
at monthly intervals is found to give quality blooms.

Irrigation
•
•
•
•
•

For successful cultivation, optimum moisture should be maintained throughout the
growing period. Gerbera requires 800-900 mm of water per year. Water can be saved
to the extent of 25-30 percent in drip method of irrigation.
The frequency of irrigation depends on the climatic and soil conditions.
Daily irrigation through drip system has to be followed based on the stage of the crop
(crop factor) and daily evaporation. Replenish water by substituting 80% of the
evaporation loss.
Farmers should be encouraged to adopt water harvesting and conserving techniques for
better utilization and efficiency for the important natural resources.
Quality of water used for irrigation is equally important and water quality should be
tested periodically. The irrigation water should be free from excess carbonates,
bicarbonates and chlorides.

Page | 37

Inter culture
•
•

Leaf pruning has to be done at regular intervals. Retain only 14-15 green leaves/plant at
a given time.
This helps in improving air circulation and minimizing the incidence of foliar diseases. It
also eases the cultural operations like spraying.

Weeding
•
•

The beds should be kept weed free throughout the crop period.
Resort to manual weeding. In general, 3-5 manual weeding will be required for the entire
cropping period.

Harvesting and post-harvest handling:
• Gerbera starts flowering in about three months after planting.
• Harvesting of flowers should be done when outer two rows of disc florets have fully
developed or when outer row of disc florets is perpendicular to the stalk.
• The cut flower should be pulled rather than cut, because cutting leaves a stem stub on
growing plant that encourages the development of diseases.
• Engage trained workers to ensure clean harvesting without any damage to the flowers
• Harvesting has to be done during the cool hours of the day. All the containers into which
the flowers are placed should be cleaned before use and hold clean water.
• Precooling of flowers to remove the field heat is an important operation to lower
respiration and prolong vase life of flowers.
• Grading of the flowers have to be done based on stalk length, flower diameter and quality
of flowers discarding diseased, damaged and abnormal flowers.
• Damaged/bruised flowers should be discarded and disposed hygienically.
• The individual flowers are sleeved using polyfilm cups to prevent petal damage during
handling and transport.
• For local market, 10 flowers are bunched and transported in containers holding water. For
distant markets, up to 50 sleeved flowers are transported in telescopic cardboard boxes of
dimension 100 x 10x 30 cm.
• Gerbera can withstand dry storage at 2-50C for two days and wet storage at 4-70C for four
days.
• Maintenance of proper cold chain post-harvest to arrival at the consumer end prolongs the
vase life and retains the flower quality.

Crop protection
Aphids, whitefly, leaf miner, thrips and mites are some of the major pests of gerbera. Nematode
infestation also is widely found in gerbera polyhouses. Major diseases are crown and root rot,
flower bud rot and powdery mildew. Integrated approach to pest and disease management
ensures better control and in safe crop production.

Insect management
•
•
•
•

Grow resistant/tolerant varieties to avoid/ minimize pest incidence.
Aphids and white fly can be controlled by spraying Imidacloprid @ 2 ml/l or Dimethoate
30 EC @ 2 ml/l
Spray insecticides like Imidacloprid (0.005%), or Fipronil (0.01%) at fortnightly intervals
after planting to manage sucking pests.
Apply neem cake @ 250 kg/ha to the soil to reduce leaf miner incidence. Spray Abamectin

Page | 38

•

•
•

1.9 EC @ 0.4 ml/l to control leaf miner.
If mite incidence is noticed, spray Neem soap 1 % or neem oil 1% mixed with synthetic
acaricide like dicofol 18.5 EC @ 1.5 ml/l or wettable sulphur 80 WP (3.0 g/l). Spray lower
surface of the leaves where mites are generally found. Abamectin 1.9 EC @ 0.4 ml/l is
also effective against mites.
Yellow sticky trap and blue sticky traps can be installed to monitor and attract sucking
pests. This will also prevent transmission of virus to plants as these sucking pests act as
vectors.
Need based spray of spinosad 45 SC @ 0.3ml/l, indoxacarb 14.5 SC @ 0.75 ml/l or
flubendiamide 20 WG @ 0.2 g/l is effective for borers.

Nematode management

•
•
•
•

•
•

Use of nematode free planting material and growing antagonistic crops like marigold,
mucuna (velvet bean) before planting gerbera
Maintaining the polyhouse free from weeds and alternate hosts
Application of carbofuran 3G @ 1 kg a.i./ha (33 kg/ha) before planting
Apply 5 tonnes of FYM or 500 kg of neem cake / pongamia cake or one tonne of
vermicompost/ha enriched with Pseudomonas fluorescens + Trichoderma harzianum +
Paecilomyces lilacinus during the land preparation or on the beds 5 – 10 days before
planting.
Mix 20 kg of bio-pesticide enriched neem cake / pongamia cake in 200 litres of water, the
supernatant can be used for drenching @ 2 lit/ sq. m. or filter it thoroughly and send along
the drip, once in an interval of 30 days.
Alternatively, Arka Plant Growth Enhancer and Yield Promoter can be given through drip/
drenching/spraying @ 5ml/ lit. at regular interval of 30 days.

Disease management

Gladiolus
Gladiolus (Gladiolus hortensis L.), belongs to the family Iridaceae. It is one of the most
popular ornamental bulbous plants having a pivotal place as cut flower both in the domestic as
well as the international market. From the commercial point of view, it is a very important
flower crop due to its majestic flower spikes having florets of varying shapes, sizes, colours
and excellent keeping quality.

Importance and scope of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP)
Gladiolus is relatively easy to grow flower crop and is ideal for bedding and exhibition. The
flowers are used in flower arrangement, in bouquets and for indoor decorations. Demand of its
cut flower for bouquet and other floral arrangement is increasing day by day due to its long
vase-life and economic value. The concept of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) has assumed
importance in recent years in the context of the concerns on environmental sustainability of
agriculture. In the production practices of gladiolus, lot of inorganic fertilizers and plant
protection chemicals are being utilized. Appropriate adoption of Good Agricultural Practices
and use of quality inputs at optimum time enables economical and sustainable gladiolus crop
production. A set of Good Agricultural Practices that is needed to be followed for gladiolus
crop production is enlisted below.

Planting material
•
•
•
•
•
•

For commercial production of gladiolus, improved varieties or hybrids released by research
organizations and state agricultural universities or planting material produced by registered
ornamental nurseries should be used.
Gladiolus corms should meet the minimum requirement of the standards with regard to
size, uniformity, vigour and should be free of pest and diseases.
Efforts should be made to use gladiolus varieties/hybrids which are resistant to major pests
and diseases.
The nutritional requirement for varieties should be ascertained and schedule the nutrient
management accordingly.
Gladiolus can be commercially propagated by corms of 4-5 cm diameter.
Conical shaped corms / high crowned corms are preferred over flat ones as propagule to
achieve uniform crop stand.

Cultural practices
Land preparation
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

The site selected for gladiolus planting should be sunny protected from stormy winds, by
wind breaks or hedge.
They will not perform well if planted in shaded and poorly drained places. Poor drainage
will result in rotting of corms.
Site selection should be followed by soil and water testing to ensure the suitability for
cultivation.
Well drained fertile loamy to sandy loam soil with adequate aeration and pH of 6.5-7 is
highly preferred for gladiolus cultivation.
The soil must be ploughed to a depth of at least 30 cm.
Raised beds with dimensions of 30cm height, 90 cm width and convenient length should
be prepared leaving 40-50 cm path width between two beds.
Raised beds ensure adequate drainage of excess water, ensures proper aeration for the
roots and can be combined with drip irrigation and fertigation system.

Manures and Manuring
•

For the proper upkeep of soil health and to improve the soil organic matter, 20 tonnes of
well decomposed farm yard manure should be applied in one hectare at least 15 days prior
to planting.
It should be ensured that organic compost/ farm yard manure used should be free from
weed seeds, pathogens, nematodes, or any other harmful microbes.
Well decomposed FYM/Vermicompost/ Neem cake has to be enriched by mixing with 1
kg of each of biocontrol agents like Pseudomonas fluorescens + Trichoderma harzianum
+ Paecilomyces lilacinus formulation under shade. It has to be covered with mulch and
an optimum moisture of 25 - 30% should be maintained for a period of 15 days.
Intermittent mixing should be done to ensure proper and uniform distribution of moisture.
After 15 days, it has to be incorporated into the beds before planting for control of
nematodes.
Well decomposed FYM should be enriched with bio-fertilizers viz.,
Azospirillum/Azotobacter, Phosphate solubilizing bacteria or Arka microbial consortium
@ 1.0 kg each/ tonne of farm yard manure and apply to the main field. This will reduce the
requirement of inorganic fertilizers.

•
•

•

Fertilizer application to soil
•
•
•
•
•
•

Excess and non-judicious application of inorganic fertilizers should be avoided as it
will lead to soil and water pollution.
Inorganic fertilizers should be applied based on the analysis of the soil and
recommendations only. This will help in providing optimum amount of nutrients to the
crop.
Application of 120 kg N, 150 kg P2O5 and 150 kg K2O per hectare is recommended
At planting time, 60 kg N and entire dose of P2O5 and K2O is applied as basal dose.
The remaining N is given in two split doses, 30 and 60 days after planting. i.e. first dose
at 4-6 leaf stage and second at earthing up stage i.e. 6-8 weeks after planting.
Fertilizers should be applied in such a way that it should be easily accessible to the plant
roots.

Planting
•
•
•
•
•
•

•

Planting of gladiolus corms is done on raised beds in double row system with one drip
line per bed.
To encourage sprouting of corms, the brown dry scales or the tunics are removed.
The corms should be disinfected properly before planting to reduce the chances of
disease infestation.
Gladiolus corms which are healthy, disease free with diameter of 4 to 5 cm should be
selected and planted at a spacing of 30 x 20 cm and depth of 5 to 10 cm.
Shallow planting of corms is essential. Deep planting will result in poor production of
cormels and also cause decaying of corms.
Planting is done during September - October and the corms are planted up to NovemberDecember.
Arka Microbial Consortium@12.5kg/ha /any certified consortium of bio-fertilizers can
be drenched 2 weeks after planting to enhance the growth.

Irrigation
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Judicious use of water is possibly the most important single factor in the production of
the best gladiolus spikes.
Optimum moisture should be maintained throughout the growing period for successful
gladiolus crop production
Soil should have sufficient moisture at the time of planting so that no irrigation is
required till sprouting.
Frequency of irrigation depends on the prevailing climatic conditions and type of soil.
A gladiolus crop must not be allowed to suffer from water stress especially when spikes
are emerging.
During warm weather conditions, irrigation to the crop can be done twice a week, and
once in a week during winter.
Over watering should be avoided.
After harvesting of the flower spikes, watering should be reduced.
Irrigation should be withheld at least 4-6 days before lifting of corms. This would help
in easy and effective lifting of corms and cormels.

Inter culture
•
•
•
•

When the shoots are about 20 cm tall, they are covered by heaping the soil up to a height
of 10 to 15 cm.
Earthing up is essential after 6-8 weeks of planting corms, or before the emergence of
spike. This enables the plants to grow erect despite high winds and rains and suppresses
weed growth.
Earthing up the soil is a must in case of light soils. These plants need staking for its
satisfactory growth and if not staked may fall or break due to wind.
In cases where the spikes grow longer or stems are not strong enough to bear the lodging
by wind, they are supported with about 1.5 meters strong stakes.

Weeding
•
•

The beds should be kept free from weeds throughout the crop period.
Regular need based manual weeding is required for the entire cropping period.

Harvesting and post-harvest handling
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

After planting the corms, gladioli blooms in two to three months, depending upon the
species and variety.
The flower spike should be cut as close to the base as possible with a sharp knife or a
scissors after the first floret on the spike has opened. The other florets on the same spike
will open when placed in water.
While harvesting or cutting of the spike, care should be taken that at least four to six basal
leaves should be retained on the plant to ensure proper development of corms and cormels.
For the local market, flower spikes are cut when 1-2 lower most florets on the spike have
opened and for the distant market, when the colour has fully developed in mature unopened
buds.
Immediately after cutting, the spike should be immersed (up to 15 cm from base) in a clean
bucket containing water
Harvesting of spikes should be done during the cool hours of the day.
Precooling of flower spikes to remove the field heat may be followed to lower respiration
and prolong the vase life.
Damaged/bruised flower spikes should be discarded.

Page | 42

•

Cut flower spikes are bunched and transported in clean containers holding water.

Harvesting and Storage of Corms
Lifting of Corms and Cormels
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Once the spikes are cut out, the leaves begin to turn yellow.
Plenty of moisture, followed by a dry period, before lifting ensure the formation of large
corms.
Gradually the water supply is reduced till the leaves get dried naturally.
After 3 - 4 weeks corms and cormels are lifted from the ground.
Corms are matured when 25% cormels have become brown which generally take 30 to
45 days from flowering when the leaves also start yellowing.
Corms and cormels should be dug out with the help of a spade.
Soil should be dug deep in order to take out all the cormels.
The corms are checked for any disease infection and the affected corms are discarded.

Curing of corms
•
•
•

Curing is one of the essential post-harvest operations for successful storage of corms.
After lifting and removing the adhering soil, the corms and cormels of each cultivar are
kept in trays in a shady but well-ventilated place for about a fortnight.
For curing, the layers of corms should not exceed three, which may be cured for five
weeks at 21°C.

Cleaning, Grading and Storage of corms
•
•
•

After the corms are fully cured, these are cleaned, and diseased ones discarded.
Treat the corms with carbendazim (2g/l) or captan (2g/l) and dried under shade which
protects them from diseases during storage.
The corms and cormels are graded in different grade-sizes and cold stored at 4 to 6oc

Crop protection
Aphids, thrips, bud borer, cut worms, loopers, grubs, beetles and bulb mites are the common
insect pests of gladiolus. Nematode infestation also is widely found in gladiolus. Gladioli are
infected by several fungal, bacterial and viral diseases. Gladiolus is highly susceptible to fungal
diseases like wilt, corm rot, leaf and flower blight, leaf spot, dry rot or neck rot, storage rot etc.
Integrated approach to pest and disease management ensures better control and in safe crop
production.

Insect management
•
•
•
•
•

Grow resistant/tolerant varieties to avoid/ minimize pest incidence.
Thrips
can be controlled by drenching the soil with chlorpyriphos (0.1 %) and spraying
of dimethoate 30 EC @2 ml/litre or acephate 75 SP @1g/litre or imidacloprid 17.8 SL @
0.5 ml/litre at 2 weeks interval
Bud borers can be managed by application of HaNPV@ 250 LE/ha followed by spray with
neem formulation@ 2ml/l. Spray quinalphos 25 EC @ 2ml/l at fortnightly interval
Cut worms can be managed by application of SINPV @ 250 LE/ha followed by spray with
neem formulation @ 2 ml/l. Spray quinalphos 25 EC @ 2ml/l or cypermethrin 10 EC @ 1
ml/l at fortnightly interval
Spraying of neem or pongamia oil 0.1 % controls mites. If the mite incidence is severe,

Page | 43

•

spray abamectin 1.9 EC @ 0.5 ml/l
Avoid spraying of the same insecticide repeatedly, as it may result in insecticide resistance
by the target pest.

Nematode management

•
•
•

•
•

Use nematode free planting material and grow antagonistic crops like marigold, mucuna
etc. before planting gladiolus corms
Treat gladiolus corms with bio-pesticides like Pseudomonas fluorescens or Trichoderma
harzianum or Paecilomyces lilacinus @ 10g/kg.
1 tonne of well decomposed FYM should be enriched with 2kg each of the biocontrol
agents like Trichoderma harzianum, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Paecilomyces lilacinus
and left under shade for 2 to 3 weeks at 25 – 30% moisture. This has to be thoroughly mixed
once in three days and applied in field prior to planting.
For the standing crop, biopesticide enriched neem cake can be mixed in water (1: 10 ratio),
thoroughly filtered and applied through the drip or as soil drench.
Chemical nematicide, carbofuran 3 G @ 1 kg a.i. per ha can be applied at planting and
repeated after 45 days.

Disease management
•

•
•

In order to control Fusarium wilt, it is advisable to destroy the infected corms from the field
and to spray systemic fungicide like Bavistin (2g/l) on the soil as well as on the plants in
the affected field. Treat the corms and cormels with Carbendazim (2g/l) and captan (2g/l)
for 20 minutes before planting and after harvesting.
Corm rot can be managed by hot water treatment with fungicide Carbendazim ((2g/l) and
captan (2g/l)
Leaf and flower blight can be controlled by spraying mancozeb @ 2 g/litre of water at
weekly or 10 days intervals.

Crossandra
Crossandra [Crossandra infundibuliformis L. (Nees).] commonly known as 'Fire Cracker' plant
is a herbaceous perennial, evergreen semi-shrub growing to a height of up to 4 feet. It is an
important commercial loose flower crop having great demand in the form of garlands, venis
and gajras for hair adornment, religious and decorative purpose. Though not fragrant,
crossandra flowers are very popular because of their attractive bright colour, light weight and
good keeping quality.

Soil and Climate
•
•
•
•
•

Well drained sandy loam and red soils with pH of 6 - 7.5 are ideal.
Soil has to be tested for nematodes before planting.
It requires a temperature of 30°- 35°C for growth.
If planted in shaded conditions, yield will be reduced
It is susceptible to low temperature and frost.

Propagation
Local crosssandra is multiplied through seeds. However, the triploid varieties are propagated
through terminal cuttings.

Nursery raising
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Use fresh seeds that were harvested during the previous season
Use seeds that are in good condition and free of pests
In case of rooted cuttings, take cuttings from a healthy, vigorous and disease-free mother
plant
Raised nursery beds of around 15 cm height should be prepared
Fresh seeds are sown during July-October in raised beds at 15 cm apart in lines
Watering should be done immediately after sowing and also daily.
The seedlings will be ready for transplanting in 60 days.
The required seed rate is 5 kg/ha for optimum plant population.
In triploid varieties, the terminal cuttings of length 10 cm, preferably with two buds has to
be taken.
The distal end will be dipped in 1000 ppm IBA for 30 seconds and planted in media
consisting of 1:1 ratio of sand and cocopeat inside growth chamber with 90% humidity.
The cuttings will be ready by 30 days.

Field preparation and planting
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Ensure correct spacing between plants and rows
If you plan to plant other crops as an ‘intercrop’ then select compatible species which do
not compete with main crop for inputs
If you are collecting your own seeds, label the seed packets with details of the species, the
origin and date of harvest or collection
Do not use seeds or planting material that are in poor condition or if you do not know where
they came from and when they were harvested
Do not use seeds or planting material if you do not know exactly which species and variety
they belong to
Procure seeds or planting material from reliable sources
The land has to be ploughed three or four times.
FYM @ 25 t/ha is incorporated and mixed well in the soil.

Page | 45

•
•

Ridges are formed 60 cm apart.
Two plants in a bed are recommended with 60 cm in between plants and lines.

Manuring and fertilizer application
•
•
•
•
•

Mix 2 kg each of Azospirillum and Phosphobacteria with 100 kg of FYM / ha and apply to
the soil at the time of planting.
A fertilizer dose of 33.3: 60: 60 kg/ha N: P2O5: K2O is applied as basal dose.
The crop is top dressed twice with 33.3 kg N per ha each time, the first at 3 months after
transplanting and the second 8-9 months after transplanting.
The application of fertilizers is to be necessarily followed by irrigation.
On 30 days after planting, apply neem cake 250 kg and N 40 kg/ha. Again on 90 days after
planting, apply N P K 40:20:60 kg/ha and repeat this dose at quarterly intervals for a time
period of two years.

Inter-cultivation
•
•
•
•
•

Manage weeds before they start competing with the main crop for nutrients and light
Do not allow weeds to produce seeds – this will increase weed growth the following year
Do not allow the soil to dry up due to excessive weeding
Weeding, application of fertilizer and earthing-up can be combined together for easy
maintenance of the crop.
Periodic removal of the dry spikes has to be done to enhance the yield

Irrigation
•
•
•

Irrigation is done once or twice in a week depending upon the soil moisture and weather
conditions
If drip irrigation is adopted, irrigation can be given daily. This system conserves water
besides reducing weed growth.
Use mulch to maintain moisture in the soil and to inhibit growth of weeds

Harvesting
•
•
•
•
•
•

Crossandra flowers within two to three months after planting and continues to bear flowers
throughout the year with a lean production season during rainy months.
Fully opened flowers are to be picked early in the morning by pulling the corolla out of
the calyx.
All the tools used for harvesting and containers into which the flowers are placed should
be cleaned before use
Harvesting of flowers is to be done on alternate days.
The yield of flowers is about 5-10 t/ha.
The crop duration is 3 years including ratoon crop.
